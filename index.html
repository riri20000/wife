<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Wright has opened up about her struggles with depression. She told Vanity Fair in 2018 that when she first experienced depression at the age of 20, she "was in the dark going through so many bad things". Wright credits her Christian faith with helping her overcome the depression, which she discovered after attending a London actors' Bible study meeting. To focus on her recovery and her faith, she turned down film roles. She later explained she "needed to take a break from acting" and "went on a journey to discover my relationship with God, and I became a Christian."</p>

    <td><p class="art">"It was difficult to imagine the movie without him. You’ve got to keep inspiring people, you have to move forward. When Ryan gave me that call, it was tough. He slowly, gently explained to me his intention of how we can honor Chad in this film and how we can honor what was created by us as a family. But I didn’t have my brother to pass the torch to me.”

    “I had to process that and pray and ask him if it's okay for me to do it. Once I felt at peace, that it was the right thing, I accepted. I said to Ryan I’ll do my best. I made a commitment. I was like I’ll honor God and I’ll honor Chad with Shuri in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Then it was just a process of going through this and I'm praying that we make him proud.”</p></td>
